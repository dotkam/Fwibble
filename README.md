# Fwibble

## What is a Fwibble, you may ask?

Fwibble was born out of the love of playground telephone games, silly stories with the family on road trips, and real-time, interactive social media experiences. A Fwibble combines collaboration, spontaneity, and a knack for the absurd.  

The result can be a scribble or a fractured fable. Hence: Fwibble!

### Game Play:
Participants take turns typing 6-word additions to the Fwibble; these individual snippets are called Fwibs. Sometimes a sentence will be left incomplete, so it’s up to the next player to finish that thought. This strategy leads to the zany Fwibble fun we’re all so fond of. The overall game is timed, and when the time expires the Fwibble is finished: so make those Fwibs fly off your fingers, players!

##Development Environment Setup

### Webpack

How to start up the webpack database:
You'll need to do a global install of webpack: `npm install -g webpack`.
Then run `npm install` in your root directory.
Then type `webpack` into the command line to put all this stuff into a dist. folder.
Run an `npm start`, and you should now be able to pull up the site on localhost:8080.
If you want to automatically update your in-browser view when you make changes, you can run `webpack -w`.
Running `webpack -p` (p for production) will minify and uglify the dist files.

### Database Initialization

To initialize the PostgreSQL environment, type `initdb fwibbleDB` in console, then 
`postgres -D fwibbleDB` to open the connection to the database environment.
In another console tab type `createdb development` or `createdb test`.
This creates the database in the FwibbleDB folder.
To load schema, depending on environment, type:
  `psql "dbname=development options=--search_path=public" -f db/fwibble.sql`
OR
  `psql "dbname=test options=--search_path=public" -f db/fwibble.sql`
To seed the database with information, type `node db/db_setup.js`.<br/>
<br/>
IF NEEDED:
   Delete all database tables, while Postgres is running, with `dropdb development`.
   Start over at `createdb` steps to recreate database tables.

### Express Server 

Ensure database is running with `postgres -D fwibbleDB`.
In another terminal tab run `npm start`.
This will allow connection through `localhost:3000` for endpoint and API testing.
