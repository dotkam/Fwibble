How to start up the webpack database:
You'll need to do a global install of webpack: <npm install -g webpack>.
Then run <npm install> in your root directory.
Then type <webpack> into the command line to put all this stuff into a dist. folder.
Run an <npm start>, and you should now be able to pull up the site on localhost:8080.
If you want to automatically update your in-browser view when you make changes, you can run <webpack -w>.
Running <webpack -p> (p for production) will minify and uglify the dist files.
